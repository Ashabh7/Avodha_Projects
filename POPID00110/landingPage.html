          <p>
            The MERN stack, an acronym for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and
            Node.js, represents a modern and powerful framework for building
            dynamic and scalable web applications. This stack has gained
            popularity due to its ability to streamline the development process
            by using a single language—JavaScript—across both client and server
            sides. Each component of the MERN stack plays a crucial role,
            collectively enabling developers to create robust applications with
            efficiency and flexibility. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, forms the
            backbone of the MERN stack. Unlike traditional relational databases,
            MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This
            schema-less structure allows for rapid iteration and adaptability,
            making it well-suited for applications that handle diverse and
            evolving data. Its scalability ensures that it can manage large
            volumes of data while maintaining performance, which is essential
            for modern applications that experience high user traffic and
            complex data interactions.
